            <!--Paragraph #1-->
            <h1><strong>PhoneGap</strong></h1>

            <p>If you are getting into Hybrid Applications for the first time, PhoneGap may be something you
                should consider using. Setting it up almost takes no time at all and it is very easy, just upload
                your code to a server which builds the app for you! 
                <br><br>
                The technology has a free and paid service, so you don't have to pay anything at all to try it out!
                PhoneGap works as a bridge between the code you make and the native code via a JavaScript API.
                On top of all of this, you are free to use reactive APIs such as Bootstrap or Semantic UI.
                <br><br>
                Although it is nice, it is not perfect. There is no help regarding UI, you will have to rely on your own HTML and CSS
                code for styling. Another thing is that since 2020, Adobe which originally bought the technology from Nitobi has discontinued
                investing in it.
            </p>

            <!--Paragraph #2--> 
            <h1><strong>React Native</strong></h1>

            <p>React Native is also a solid choice. The technology allows you to build mobile applications that look, feel, and preform like native ones.
                The technology uses its own Native Components rather than using the standard DOM elements. 
                React Native is fast to build, helps make simplified UI, and there are plenty of resources online to help you use the Hybrid Technology.
                <br><br>
                Although it is useful, nothing is perfect. The application's use of cross-platorm technology makes testing more difficult. 
                Compared to other platforms, React Native also has weaker Android support.
            </p>

            <!--Paragraph #3--> 
            <h1><strong>Flutter</strong></h1>

            <p>If you love to try out new platforms on the market then Flutter could be the choice for you!
                Flutter is a Google-owned platform that they also use themselves. The platform allows for fast development and expressive UI.
                Many large companies have also started to use this platform such as Alibaba Group, Capital One, and Ebay!
                <br><br>
                A few of Flutter's cons do include a lack of resources and libraries to use. This is mainly because the platform
                is so new. This shouldn't be an issue in the future when the platform is fully developed and more resources are made for it.
                It is a definite recommendation for the long term.
